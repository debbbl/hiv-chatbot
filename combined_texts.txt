General information about STIs/STDs What are Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)? STIs, also known as Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) are infections of bacterial, viral, fungal or parasitic origin that are transmitted from person to person through sexual activity (anal, vaginal or oral sex) or kissing.
General information about STIs/STDs What is the difference between an STI and an STD? STI (sexually transmitted infection) is an umbrella term that refers to any infection spread through sexual contact, which may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. STD (sexually transmitted disease) refers to the infection when it causes symptoms or disease. Both terms are sometimes used interchangeably.
General information about STIs/STDs What are the symptoms of STIs/STDs? Symptoms may include unusual discharge (colored or foul-smelling), itching in the genital area, sores or bumps on the genitals, burning during urination, and pain during sex. Some STIs may cause flu-like symptoms such as flu, fever, sore throat, headache and fatigue. However, these STIs may also be asymptomatic for long periods before causing symptoms.
General information about STIs/STDs How long does it take for STI/STD symptoms to appear? The incubation periods for STIs vary from days to weeks. Some infections may not be detected for years, leading to potential damage to reproductive organs.
General information about STIs/STDs Can STIs/STDs be asymptomatic? Yes, many STIs can be asymptomatic or cause mild symptoms initially. These include HIV, herpes, HPV, hepatitis B or C, trichomoniasis, syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea. It is important to test for STIs regularly for early detection, treatment and preventing transmission to sexual partner(s).
General information about STIs/STDs What should I do if I think I have an STI/STD? If you suspect you have an STI/STD, visit a healthcare provider for testing and treatment as soon as possible. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial in managing disease outcomes.
General information about STIs/STDs Are STIs/STDs life-threatening? Certain STIs/STDs when left untreated could potentially cause death in the long run: HIV, Hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV), and syphilis. These infections become life-threatening without treatment but may take years to develop, necessitating frequent screening.
General information about STIs/STDs What STIs are most common among sexually active individuals? The most commonly reported STIs are divided into two categories: bacterial or viral. Bacterial STIs include chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhea whereas viral STIs include herpes, human papillomavirus (HPV) and HIV. Less frequently, STIs of fungal or parasitic origin are also reported.
General information about STIs/STDs How are bacterial STDs/STIs like chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhea treated? A combination of oral and injectable antibiotics is used to treat bacterial STDs/STIs. It is imperative to complete the course of antibiotics, even if symptoms abate. Stopping treatment prematurely may cause antibiotic resistance, which is a global health concern, particularly in the treatment of gonorrhea.
General information about STIs/STDs Can STIs/STDs affect other parts of the body besides the genitals? Yes, STIs/STDs can affect other parts of the body, including the mouth, throat, eyes, and anus. Some infections can also spread to internal organs if left untreated. Untreated genital infections in women can lead to Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID). PID is a painful condition that may interfere with conception and pregnancy. Early diagnosis and treatment are necessary to prevent complications from STIs.
General information about STIs/STDs Can STIs/STDs be cured? Bacterial STIs/STDs like chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis can be cured with antibiotics. Viral STIs/STDs like herpes, HPV and HIV cannot be cured, but their symptoms can be managed with medication.
General information about STIs/STDs Can over-the-counter medications treat STIs/STDs? No, most STIs/STDs require prescription medications from a healthcare provider for effective treatment.
General information about STIs/STDs What should I do if my symptoms persist after treatment for an STI/STD? If symptoms persist after treatment, return to your healthcare provider for further evaluation. It may indicate a need for additional treatment or a different diagnosis.
General information about STIs/STDs Can STDs/STIs cause infertility? Yes, untreated STDs/STIs like chlamydia and gonorrhea can cause infertility by damaging the reproductive organs.
STI/STD transmission Is HIV an STI? Yes, HIV is a sexually transmitted infection.
STI/STD transmission How are STIs/STDs transmitted? Genital contact during sex (anal, vaginal or oral), kissing, needle sharing (drug use) and/or vertical transmission (mother-to-child).
STI/STD transmission Can kissing transmit STIs/STDs? Herpes is a virus commonly spread through lip-to-lip contact during kissing. Transmission is increased when one partner is symptomatic (appearance of cold sores). However, the absence of symptoms does not eliminate the risk of transmission. Additionally, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) may also be transmitted through exchange of saliva during deep, open mouth kissing. If one partner has oral HPV, it is transmissible through what is known as ‘French kissing’.
STI/STD transmission How are STIs/STDs transmitted during needle sharing? STIs such as HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C are transmitted using needles and syringes contaminated with infected blood. When contaminated syringes are reused, the infected blood is introduced to the bloodstream of an uninfected individual.
STI/STD transmission What is the risk of STI transmission from a needlestick injury (NSI)? The risk of HIV, HBV and HBC transmission from a needlestick injury is 0.3%, 30% and 3% respectively.
STI/STD transmission How can I reduce the risk of contracting STIs during sexual activity? Using condoms and dental dams, practicing safe sex, abstaining from high-risk behaviour and undergoing frequent STI screening are important steps to minimize transmission. Being aware of the signs and symptoms will also enable prompt treatment. Furthermore, the CDC recommends engaging in sexual activity with only one monogamous partner to further reduce the risk of transmission.
STI/STD transmission Is it possible to avoid contracting STIs/STDs without using condoms? Apart from condom use, other preventive methods include PrEP for HIV, regular testing, limiting the number of sexual partners at one time, and using dental dams during oral sex.
STI/STD transmission Can I get an STI/STD from sharing a toothbrush or razor? Sharing toothbrushes or razors can potentially spread bloodborne infections like Hepatitis B or C, but it is not a common mode of transmission for most STIs/STDs.
STI/STD transmission Is there a way to avoid getting infected with STDs/STIs after contact with an infected person? Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) exists for possible HIV exposure. Doxycycline can also reduce the likelihood of contracting syphilis and chlamydia by up to 75%, and gonorrhea by 50%. Hepatitis B may be treated with an HBV vaccine and administration of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). There is no established prophylaxis for other STIs/STDs.
STI/STD transmission Can PrEP use provide protection against STIs/STDs? No. PrEP is only prophylactic for HIV, not other STIs.
Common STIs/STDs Does condom usage eliminate the risk of contracting STIs/STDs? Condoms reduce transmission of STIs/STDs but do not eliminate the risk. Certain STIs such as herpes, HPV, and MCV also spread through skin-to-skin contact which condoms don’t fully protect against.
Common STIs/STDs What is herpes? Herpes is an STI caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). There are two strains: HSV-1, which usually causes oral herpes, and HSV-2, which usually causes genital herpes. However, both strains are not mutually exclusive for the oral/genital/rectal region. Herpes is incurable but symptoms can be managed.
Common STIs/STDs What is the progression of the herpes virus after infection? Upon infection, it takes 2-12 days for symptoms to appear. Disease manifestation differs between individuals and may range from only one initial outbreak to multiple recurrent outbreaks. Contrastingly, outbreaks may only occur years after the initial infection. Before an outbreak, ‘prodrome’ is reported where the virus re-activates from latency to produce symptoms such as malaise, fatigue and mild itching in the genital, rectal or oral area, preceding the appearance of painful blisters. The blisters may last up to 7 days before they crust over to produce sores. The sores may take 1-4 weeks to heal, depending on the severity of the outbreak. However, as disease manifestation differs among individuals, blisters may not appear following prodrome.
Common STIs/STDs What are the symptoms of herpes? Symptoms of herpes during an outbreak can include painful blisters or sores on the genitals, rectum, or mouth. Concurrently, itching, burning during urination, and flu-like symptoms are present. These symptoms may also precede the appearance of blisters/sores.
Common STIs/STDs How is herpes treated? Herpes is commonly treated or managed with an antiviral drug called Acyclovir. Blisters and sores may be treated with over-the-counter creams or ointments. For those with recurrent outbreaks, lifelong Acyclovir therapy is recommended to prevent the appearance of genital sores or cold sores. However, prophylactic medication is not fail-safe and outbreaks may still occur. Lifestyle changes are also recommended as smoking, alcohol and stress have been documented to trigger herpes outbreaks.
Common STIs/STDs Why is herpes incurable? The herpesvirus can enter latency in nerve cells, where it evades detection by the immune system. The body is unable to detect the virus and mount an immune response to clear it.
Common STIs/STDs Is there a vaccine for herpes? No vaccines exist for the prophylaxis or treatment of HSV-1 or HSV-2.
Common STIs/STDs How to avoid contracting herpes? Transmission is greatly reduced when condoms are used, however, the risk is not eliminated as herpesvirus can reside beyond the region protected by a condom. Avoiding intercourse during outbreaks, regular testing and adherence to antiviral therapy can reduce the spread of herpes.
Common STIs/STDs What is HPV? HPV stands for human papillomavirus. It is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI). There are over 200 types of HPV, and about 40 can infect the genital areas. HPV can cause genital warts or certain cancers.
Common STIs/STDs What is a high-risk HPV strain? A high-risk HPV strain is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Common high-risk strains include HPV-16, HPV-18, HPV-31, HPV-33 and HPV-45. Low-risk strains are those that cause bumps or warts, also known as papilloma. Common low-risk strains are HPV-6 and HPV-11.
Common STIs/STDs How is HPV treated? In many cases, HPV will clear on its own with time. In individuals with a weak immune system or those with unhealthy lifestyle practices such as smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, HPV may produce warts or in extreme cases, cancer. The treatment for low-risk warts includes laser therapy, cryotherapy, ointments and surgical removal. As for high-risk warts, Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP), cryotherapy, laser therapy and conization are performed to remove abnormal tissue and lesions from the cervix. Vaccines for HPV are available and are recommended for men and women below the age of 30.
Common STIs/STDs What types of vaccines exist for HPV? Depending on geographical location, three types of HPV vaccines have been approved for use: Cervarix, Gardasil and Gardasil9.
Common STIs/STDs What does the HPV vaccine protect against? Cervarix protects against two high-risk strains responsible for most HPV-associated cancers (16 and 18) while Gardasil 4 offers protection against two additional strains (6, 11, 16 and 18). Gardasil9 is the most comprehensive, offering protection against 7 high-risk strains (16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) and two low-risk strains (6 and 11).
Common STIs/STDs Which of the three HPV vaccines are most widely used? Gardasil9 is currently the most widely used vaccine.
Common STIs/STDs Should I take the HPV vaccine even if I plan to have only one sexual partner throughout my life? HPV can spread via non-genital routes including oral-to-oral and skin-to-skin. Although low, the risk of transmission still exists. Discuss the need for HPV vaccination with your healthcare provider.
Common STIs/STDs How do I avoid contracting HPV? Using a condom can reduce the transmission of HPV during sex. However, HPV spreads through skin-to-skin contact and exposed regions can facilitate transmission of the virus.
Common STIs/STDs What is gonorrhea? Gonorrhea is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It can infect the genitals, rectum, and throat. Gonorrhea can spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who is infected. Sharing sex toys with an infected person can also spread gonorrhea.
Common STIs/STDs What are the symptoms of gonorrhea? Symptoms of gonorrhea can include painful urination, abnormal discharge from the penis or vagina, and, in some cases, pain or swelling in one testicle. In many cases, gonorrhea can be asymptomatic.
Common STIs/STDs What is syphilis? Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It can cause serious health problems if not treated but is curable with antibiotics.
Common STIs/STDs What are the stages of syphilis? Primary, secondary, latent and late-stage syphilis.
Common STIs/STDs What are the symptoms of syphilis? Syphilis symptoms vary by stage but can include sores, skin rashes, and mucous membrane lesions in the early stages. In later stages, it can cause damage to the heart, brain, and other organs.
Common STIs/STDs What is chlamydia? Chlamydia is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. It can infect the genitals, rectum, and throat.
Common STIs/STDs What are the symptoms of chlamydia? Common symptoms in men may include discharge from the penis and a burning sensation during urination. Less common symptoms include pain and swelling in one or both testicles and bumps. In women: Abnormal vaginal discharge, burning sensation during urination, pain during intercourse, bleeding between periods. In both men and women: Rectal pain, discharge, or bleeding if the rectum is infected. Frequent urination is also reported in women. As chlamydia may not always cause symptoms, early screening is important to prevent progression of the disease.
Common STIs/STDs What is trichomoniasis? Trichomoniasis or trich, is an STI caused by the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. It infects the urinary tract and sexual organs in both men and women.
Common STIs/STDs What are the symptoms of trichomoniasis? Trichomoniasis causes painful urination in men and women. The infection is most often benign in men but can progress to prostate inflammation and reduced fertility. Symptoms in women include foul-smelling vaginal discharge, irritation and painful urination. Untreated infections in women may lead to damage of the reproductive organs and PID. As trichomoniasis is often asymptomatic, regular screening is crucial for prompt treatment.
Common STIs/STDs What is Mgen? Mgen or Mycoplasma genitalium is a sexually transmitted bacterial infection. It primarily infects the genital region in both men and women. Oral manifestations are uncommon.
Common STIs/STDs What are the symptoms of Mgen? Symptoms of Mgen are discharge from the penis or vagina and a burning sensation when urinating. Infections are usually asymptomatic; therefore, it is important to get tested early.
STI/STD Testing What is Molloscum contagiosum? The Molloscum contagiosum virus (MCV) is a viral skin infection that can be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact, including sexual activity. Main symptoms are the appearance of bumps in the genital area, which usually resolve within 12 months without treatment. In immunocompromised individuals, treatment is administered to prevent proliferation of the virus and systemic infection.
STI/STD Testing What are the benefits of regular STD/STI testing? Regular testing helps with early detection and treatment, prevents the spread of infections to others, and promotes overall sexual health.
STI/STD Testing How does regular testing fit into a healthy sexual lifestyle? Regular testing is a key component of a healthy sexual lifestyle, promoting awareness, responsibility, and proactive management of sexual health.
STI/STD Testing Why is regular STI/STD testing important? Regular testing helps detect infections early, which can ensure timely treatment to prevent serious health complications and reduce the spread of infections to others.
STI/STD Testing Can early detection of STIs/STDs improve treatment outcomes? Yes, early detection of STIs/STDs allows for prompt treatment, which can prevent complications, reduce the risk of transmission, and improve overall health outcomes.
STI/STD Testing How long after completing treatment for bacterial STDs/STIs should I get tested? For trichomoniasis, a follow up of 1-2 weeks is recommended. For gonorrhea and chlamydia follow up testing 3 months after completion of treatment is recommended. As for syphilis, testing is usually done at the 3, 6 and 12-month mark after treatment is completed. Persistence of infection may require an antibiogram or antibiotic susceptibility test to determine which antibiotics can clear the infection. Consult and discuss these options with a healthcare provider.
STI/STD Testing How can regular testing protect my partner? Regular testing helps identify infections early, allowing you to inform partner(s) and take steps to prevent transmission, such as abstaining from sex or using protection until treatment is complete.
STI/STD Testing Where can I get tested for STDs/STIs? You can get tested at clinics, hospitals, community health centers, LGBTQ+ health centers, and some pharmacies. Many organizations also offer free or low-cost testing services.
STI/STD Testing What are the risks of not getting tested for STIs/STDs? Not getting tested can lead to undiagnosed and untreated infections, which can cause serious health issues, spread to others, and increase the risk of complications like infertility and chronic pain.
STI/STD Testing What are the complications from untreated STIs/STDs? Untreated STIs/STDs may lead to inflammation of the reproductive and/or urinary organs (bladder, urethra, ureter). Inflammation that leads to permanent damage of organs is irreversible. In women, the inflammation of the reproductive organs in Pelvic Inflammatory Disorder (PID) can cause painful menstruation and may interfere with conception/pregnancy. Early testing and treatment is key in preventing long term side effects.
STI/STD Testing Can I get tested for STIs/STDs at home? Yes, there are at-home testing kits available for various STIs/STDs. These kits allow you to collect samples at home and send them to a lab for testing. However, self-collection of samples could introduce technical errors, leading to false results. Consult a healthcare professional or local pharmacist for more information.
HIV/AIDS specific questions What should I expect during an STD/STI test? During an STD/STI test, you may be required to provide urine, blood, or swab samples from the genitals, throat, or rectum, depending on the infections being tested for.
HIV/AIDS specific questions What is HIV/AIDS? HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome or AIDS is the most advanced stage of HIV infection in which the body is severely immunocompromised.
HIV/AIDS specific questions Is HIV the same as AIDS? No. HIV is a virus that infects immune cells that fight infection. AIDS is the most advanced stage of an untreated HIV infection.
HIV/AIDS specific questions What are the stages of HIV infection? HIV infection is divided into 3 stages: acute, chronic/latent and late infection (AIDS).
HIV/AIDS specific questions What is the basis of the differentiation between stages? The duration of infection with the virus, HIV and CD4+ T cell count and the corresponding symptoms.
HIV/AIDS specific questions How do the symptoms of each stage differ? The acute stage presents as a typical viral infection – fever, rash, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes diarrhea. The chronic/latent stage may be asymptomatic – with recurrent symptoms such as weight loss, swollen lymph nodes and fatigue. The late stage is the onset of AIDS, which is marked by immunodeficiency and corresponding co-infections.
HIV/AIDS specific questions Will everyone who has HIV eventually get AIDS? No.
HIV/AIDS specific questions If I have HIV, how do I prevent the onset of AIDS? The onset of AIDS can be prevented or delayed with strict adherence to Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) which suppresses the virus and preserves immune cells.
HIV/AIDS specific questions How does HIV affect the human body? Once HIV enters the bloodstream, a type of white blood cell called the CD4+ T cells (immune cells) are infected by viral particles. The genetic material of the virus is integrated into these cells, where it eventually enters into latency. The virus continues to replicate at low levels eventually leading to destruction and depletion of the CD4+ T cells. At the advanced stage where HIV replication is not controlled, the immune system is destroyed, and symptoms of AIDS are detected.
HIV/AIDS specific questions What are the symptoms of HIV in the brain? Major brain-related manifestations of HIV occur in the late-stage of infection, where AIDS is observed. This includes HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND) which is a group of cognitive disorders including HIV-Associated Dementia (HAD). Other cognitive impairments may be present simultaneously – seizures, headaches or migraines, motor dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, encephalitis and/or meningitis. In the acute or chronic stages, headaches and migraines are commonly observed.
HIV/AIDS specific questions At what point is it too late to treat HIV infection? It is never too late to start treatment. However, delaying treatment will affect the outcome of treatment. Early intervention will improve prognosis.
HIV/AIDS specific questions What is immunosuppression? Immunosuppression is the suppression of the immune system through drugs or infection. Immunosuppressive drugs such as those used for tissue/ organ transplant and the treatment of autoimmune diseases intentionally inhibit the immune response through various mechanisms, but do not destroy it. Infections like HIV cause immunosuppression by destroying the cells responsible for mounting an immune response.
HIV/AIDS specific questions Can the immune system be restored during the late stage of HIV infection? Yes. AIDS is treatable with ART but the prognosis may differ among individuals, depending on age, pre-existing illnesses and drug-resistance/superinfection with HIV.
HIV/AIDS specific questions What is the prognosis for treatment during the late stage of HIV infection? Following the onset of an AIDS-related opportunistic infection, the 5-year survival rate with treatment is 65%.
HIV/AIDS specific questions Why is the chronic/latent stage asymptomatic? The chronic stage, also known as the latent stage, is when the HIV virus establishes a reservoir within CD4+ T cells (immune cells), avoiding detection by the immune system. The number of virus particles circulating is not enough to cause symptoms.
HIV/AIDS specific questions If someone is in the chronic/latent stage of infection, can they still spread the virus? Yes. The HIV virus replicates continuously in the body without medical intervention. Viral shedding occurs in the seminal fluids, enabling transmission.
HIV/AIDS specific questions Can someone have HIV and not know it? Yes. In the initial stages, HIV symptoms are indistinguishable from other viral infections. The virus then enters a latent stage, where it is asymptomatic. For this reason, HIV can go undetected for many years without regular testing.
HIV/AIDS specific questions Can I contract HIV from someone who is asymptomatic? Yes.
HIV/AIDS specific questions What are the most common comorbidities in HIV patients? Cardiovascular disease, renal and liver disease, metabolic disorders, cancers, mental health disorders, opportunistic infections, bone diseases.
HIV/AIDS specific questions What infections could complicate HIV prognosis? Infections like Hepatitis C, Hepatitis B and tuberculosis could possibly complicate the outcome of HIV treatment due to its effects on the immune system.
HIV/AIDS specific questions Can HIV cause other infections to get worse? Yes. HIV can exacerbate pre-existing infections by destroying the immune system’s ability to fight off disease.
HIV/AIDS specific questions What is the Lazarus effect? The Lazarus effect occurs when patients who appear to be dying from AIDS are reinvigorated (appear to be raised from the dead) when (re)administered with ART.
HIV/AIDS specific questions What is wasting syndrome? PLHIV with advanced, untreated disease may experience wasting syndrome, in which unintended weight loss exceeding 10% of a person’s body weight occurs alongside symptoms such as diarrhea and fever. Symptoms that persist for more than 30 days are classified as wasting syndrome. Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) combined with a temporary high-calorie diet to increase calorie consumption is used to increase body weight and improve prognosis.
HIV/AIDS specific questions What is the prognosis for untreated HIV? The prognosis is 8-10 years before death.
HIV/AIDS specific questions What is the prognosis if HIV is under control? It is possible to live a lifespan comparable to an uninfected person with controlled HIV.
HIV/AIDS specific questions What is the prognosis for HIV-related dementia? The estimated 1-year survival rate for HIV-related dementia is 65%.
HIV/AIDS specific questions What are the hallmarks of AIDS? A variety of opportunistic bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic infections including several types of cancers. These include-: Bacterial: Tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia Fungal: Cryptococcus, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis Viral: Herpes simplex, herpes zoster Parasitic: Toxoplasmosis, histoplasmosis Cancers: Kaposi’s sarcoma, anal and cervical cancers, lymphomas.
HIV/AIDS specific questions What is an opportunistic infection (OI)? Opportunistic infections are pathogenic infections that can be controlled by the immune system of a healthy person. In people with a compromised immune system (such as those seen in AIDS), the immune system is unable to protect the body against these pathogens, causing infection.
HIV/AIDS specific questions How does an HIV-positive person avoid getting opportunistic infections? Adherence to Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) preserves the immune system, preventing compromise and infection by opportunistic pathogens.
HIV/AIDS specific questions How does AIDS manifest in the eyes? The distinguishing symptom observed in the eyes during late-stage AIDS is cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis which causes inflammation of the eyes.
HIV/AIDS specific questions What do HIV rashes look like? In the early stages of HIV infection, rashes appear red or flushed on fair skin and purplish on darker skin. These bumps are usually flat and not raised.
HIV/AIDS specific questions How does AIDS manifest in the nervous system? HIV encephalopathy, cryptococcal meningitis and toxoplasmosis have been notably observed in AIDS. These infections cause damage to the brain and nervous system.
HIV/AIDS specific questions How does AIDS manifest on skin? Telltale diseases like Kaposi’s sarcoma and manifestations of herpesviruses and Molloscum contagiosum are commonly observed in AIDS.
HIV/AIDS specific questions What is tuberculosis? Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is transmitted through the air when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. TB primarily affects the lungs, forming tubercles, which are small nodules indicative of the disease. TB is curable with a 6-month course of different antibiotics but poor adherence to treatment has led to the proliferation of drug-resistant strains that are more difficult to treat.
HIV/AIDS specific questions What tests can detect tuberculosis? Tuberculosis is tested using three different tests depending on the symptoms. For latent TB, a Mantoux Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) or a TB skin test is performed, where a small amount of protein that detects tuberculosis is injected beneath the skin. The test is then read after 24 hours, where a positive reaction produces a rash. For active TB, a sputum test or a blood test that detects bacteria is performed. For advanced TB, a combination of either the sputum or blood test with a chest x-ray is performed to check for tubercles in the lungs.
HIV/AIDS specific questions Does TB increase susceptibility to HIV? Not directly. However, an immune system weakened by TB may be more susceptible to HIV if exposed. Furthermore, the socioeconomic and environmental factors (poverty and poor sanitation) associated with TB infection may also increase the risk of contracting HIV.
HIV/AIDS specific questions Is tuberculosis fatal? TB can be fatal if left untreated. However, adherence to treatment combined with healthy lifestyle habits (abstaining from smoking) can eliminate the disease and improve prognosis. Infection with a drug-resistant strain may complicate treatment options and lower long-term prognosis.
HIV/AIDS specific questions Is there a vaccine for TB? Yes, the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine offers protection to children and infants against severe forms of TB. Protection against all forms of TB in adults is not significant.
HIV/AIDS specific questions Does tuberculosis leave any long-term damage to the lungs? Yes. Early detection and treatment can prevent/ minimize damage to the lungs.
HIV/AIDS specific questions What are the different types of TB? There are multiple types of TB disease which are broadly categorized into pulmonary TB (lungs) and extrapulmonary TB which may affect the bones, genitourinary system, lymphatic system or even multiple organs and the bloodstream.
HIV/AIDS specific questions Is tuberculosis an STI/STD? No. Tuberculosis is an airborne bacterium and is not transmitted through sexual activity. However, intimate contact with a person who has active tuberculosis and is exhibiting symptoms (coughing), could increase your chances of contracting it. Subsequently, genitourinary TB may cause sores and lesions in the genital area that secrete the bacterium. Although rare, transmission through sex is possible.
HIV/AIDS specific questions How does adherence to ART improve TB outcome? Adherence to ART preserves the immune system and enables the body to fight infection. Without ART, the body eventually enters a state of immunodeficiency and is incapable of fighting off infection.
HIV/AIDS specific questions Does infection with drug-resistant TB affect HIV outcome? The increased number of drugs needed to treat drug-resistant TB may put an increased strain on bodily systems, potentially affecting disease outcome.
HIV/AIDS specific questions Are there vaccines for HIV? No.
HIV/AIDS specific questions Why are there no vaccines for HIV? A combination of factors including the complex nature of the virus – high mutation rate, highly diverse surface protein candidates (which vary among strains), lack of a suitable animal model to study the virus, poor immune response upon infection with HIV (unlike other robust viruses like polio and measles).
HIV/AIDS specific questions Is HIV curable? HIV is incurable but can be treated and managed.
HIV/AIDS specific questions Are my chances of contracting HIV lower if I lead an active, healthy lifestyle? Without the use of condoms or PrEP, the chances are not lowered.
HIV/AIDS specific questions Can I live a normal life with HIV? Strict adherence to the ART regimen combined with a healthy lifestyle can increase the likelihood of a normal lifespan. Abstaining from high-risk behaviour could reduce the risk of contracting other STIs that might complicate treatment.
HIV/AIDS specific questions Can stress or mental health disorders affect the outcome of HIV infection? Stress and mental health disorders could negatively affect the immune system, potentially compromising the immune system’s ability to fight the virus.
HIV/AIDS specific questions Is depression a sign that HIV has relapsed? The only definitive way to determine if treatment has relapsed is by performing a viral load assay.
HIV Virology Under what circumstances can HIV relapse occur? HIV relapse can occur if there is non-adherence to Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART), if a person has been infected with a different virus strain that is unresponsive to therapy, if the virus undergoes a mutation and becomes resistant to therapy
HIV Virology What is the incubation period for HIV? Two to four weeks.
HIV Virology Is HIV a virus or a bacterium? HIV is a virus.
HIV Virology What is a strain of a virus? A strain is a subtype of a virus that is different from another subtype because of differences in structure or genetic composition. The differences are usually not significant enough for the strains to be categorized as entirely different viruses.
HIV Virology How many strains of HIV are there? Two (HIV-1 & HIV-2), with further classification into groups and subtypes.
HIV Virology What is the difference between strains, groups and subtypes? Strains are divisions of the virus based on genetic similarity (HIV-1 and HIV-2). Within these two divisions, multiple groups exist, which are further categorized into different subtypes. Each group and subtype has a geographical distribution.
HIV Virology How similar is HIV-1 and HIV-2? HIV-1 and HIV-2 share approximately 60% similarity in genetic composition. In simple terms, there is a significant difference between the compositions of both strains and its characteristics.
HIV Virology Is one strain more dangerous than the other? Generally, no. However, HIV-1 has a faster disease progression with increased transmissibility compared to HIV-2.
HIV Virology Which strain of HIV is more common? HIV-1 is more prevalent than HIV-2.
HIV Virology What is the origin of HIV? Both HIV-1 and HIV-2 are generally acknowledged to have been zoonoses that jumped from non-human primates to humans in the early 20th century.
HIV Virology If I have HIV, will the virus eventually mutate? As the HIV virus has a high, error-prone replication rate, mutations are generally anticipated. Strict medication adherence reduces the likelihood of viral mutations.
HIV Virology Can I be infected with more than one strain of HIV? Yes. Concurrent infection with two or more strains of HIV is known as HIV superinfection.
HIV Virology Is being infected with both strains of HIV more dangerous than being infected with a single strain? Yes. Superinfection could potentially complicate treatment avenues as both strains may not respond to the same treatments. Disease progression may also be accelerated.
HIV Virology Why do some people remain resistant to HIV infection? HIV requires a specific co-receptor on the surface of CD4+ T cells for infection, called CCR5. Certain individuals genetically carry CD4+ T cells that lack or have non-functional CCR5 co-receptors, therefore the virus is unable cause infection.
HIV Virology Which group or subtype of HIV is most common? Group M of HIV-1 is thought to account for 90% of HIV-1 cases globally and is therefore the most common group. Of the different subtypes, subtype C is predominant and occurs in parts of Asia, South America and Africa.
HIV Virology Which group or subtype of HIV is the rarest? Groups N and P are thought to be the rarest, with only a few documented cases of each occurring in Cameroon.
HIV Virology Is the proliferation of drug-resistant HIV strains accelerated? In certain cases, yes. The limited number of treatments available allows the virus to multiply in hosts, enabling transmission across geographical areas where existing treatments are ineffective.
HIV Virology What is a circulating recombinant form? Circulating Recombinant Form (CRF) is variant of HIV (usually HIV-1), which arises from genetic recombination from one or more strains. When a person is infected with two or more strains of HIV, the genetic material of the virus strains can mix, creating new variants. CRFs are identified through genetic sequencing and assigned a letter and number code (CRF01_AE).
HIV Transmission Do both strains of HIV (HIV-1 and HIV-2) cause AIDS? Yes. All strains and sub-types of HIV cause human immunodeficiency or AIDS.
HIV Transmission How is HIV transmitted? Through unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected person not undergoing treatment. Sharing needles among HIV-infected persons. Vertical transmission (mother-to-child).
HIV Transmission Is HIV an airborne virus? HIV is not airborne and cannot be transmitted through sneezing or coughing, but through body fluids (blood, genital fluids) and vertical transmission (mother-to-child).
HIV Transmission Is HIV waterborne? HIV is not considered waterborne as it cannot survive in water sources (e.g. drinking water or swimming pools). Generally, outside of the body and bodily fluids, the virus does not survive for extended periods of time.
HIV Transmission Can HIV survive outside the body? Generally, no. Outside the body, HIV can only survive in blood, bodily secretions (rectal, vaginal, seminal) or breastmilk.
HIV Transmission What is environmental transmission? Environmental transmission is the transmission of an infectious agent through environmental sources such as air, water, food or fomites.
HIV Transmission How long does HIV survive in blood outside the body? In fresh blood, HIV can survive for several hours to a day at room temperature. In dried blood, HIV survival goes up to 6 days. However, it is agreed upon that the concentration of viruses is too low to cause infection via environmental transmission.
HIV Transmission How long does HIV survive in bodily secretions? Outside the body, HIV does not survive in seminal, vaginal or rectal secretions for more than a few hours.
HIV Transmission How long does HIV survive in breastmilk? HIV can survive in breastmilk at room temperature for up to several days. This is because breastmilk contains immune cells such as the CD4+ T cells, where the virus can replicate and remain stable.
HIV Transmission If HIV cannot be transmitted through food or drink, why is it transmissible through breastmilk? Babies are at risk due to their immature immune systems, and frequent consumption of breastmilk which can harbour high viral loads if the mother is not being treated. HIV can enter an infant’s bloodstream through the oral or gastrointestinal mucosa and cause infection.
HIV Transmission What is the risk of HIV transmission for an infant who has consumed infected breastmilk? The risk of HIV transmission through breastfeeding is 1% at 6 months and 3% at 1 year.
HIV Transmission Can an adult contract HIV from consumption of breastmilk? Yes, but the likelihood is low. Consumption of breastmilk from a woman with a high viral load combined with the presence of open cuts, sores or lesions in the mouth or throat could potentially expose an adult to HIV.
HIV Transmission How does HIV spread through sharing of needles? The presence of residual blood from an HIV-infected person causes transmission when contaminated needles are shared with an uninfected person.
HIV Transmission Do needlestick injuries always cause transmission of HIV? No. However, the risk is higher if blood was visible on the needle and if the injured individual is immunocompromised.
HIV Transmission How long can HIV survive in a syringe or needle? The duration of time varies according to temperature, size of the syringe and quantity of blood. However, it is generally agreed upon that HIV can survive for longer durations in enclosed syringes. At 4°C, it was found that up to 50% of the virus was still viable after 42 days.
HIV Transmission Can I reuse a needle that has been washed in soap and water? Washing with soap and water is insufficient for decontamination because microscopic traces of blood could still exist, even though the needle appears to be clean. Only steam or chemical sterilization methods offer complete decontamination of medical equipment. These methods destroy most infectious agents, ensuring that the equipment is safe to be reused.
HIV Transmission What is the course of action after a needlestick injury with a contaminated needle? Thoroughly wash the injured area with soap and water. Then visit the nearest healthcare provider to begin PEP for HIV and other infections.
HIV Transmission Can touching the blood of an infected person transmit HIV? No. However, this practice is unsanitary and could transmit other pathogens.
HIV Transmission Can HIV be transmitted through pre-cum? Yes. HIV is present in pre-ejaculate or pre-cum, so any form of unprotected sexual activity can transmit HIV.
HIV Transmission Can HIV be transmitted through un-sanitised tattoo needles/ body piercing equipment/ nail parlours? With regular sanitization of equipment there is zero risk of transmission.
HIV Transmission Can HIV be transmitted even if the needle does not penetrate the bloodstream? No. HIV requires contact with blood for transmission.
HIV Transmission Can HIV be transmitted through non-hollow needles? The risk is extremely low. HIV is usually transmitted through hollow needles which are contaminated with blood.
HIV Transmission Can HIV be spread through swimming pool water? No.
HIV Transmission Can I get HIV at the dentist? The risk is minimal. Healthcare providers are required by law to adhere to strict disinfection protocols that eliminate all risk of dissemination.
HIV Transmission Can HIV be transmitted from animals? HIV is specific to humans and cannot be transmitted to animals.
HIV Transmission Can HIV spread from sharing a toilet seat? No.
HIV Transmission Can I get HIV from oral sex? Yes, but the risk is minimal.  Other STIs like herpes and hepatitis can be transmitted via oral sex. The usage of condoms and dental dams can reduce transmission.
HIV Transmission What are the chances of me contracting HIV after having unprotected sex? Up to 2%.
HIV Transmission What is vertical transmission of HIV? Transmission of the virus from an infected mother to her child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.
HIV Transmission Does the use of drugs (methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin, etc.) increase my risk of contracting HIV? Yes. Injection drug use facilitates the transmission of HIV through unsanitary needle sharing. Furthermore, drugs may reduce inhibitions and encourage unsafe sexual activity by impairing judgement.
HIV Transmission Can the use of hormonal contraception increase my chances of contracting HIV? There is not enough data to rule out if hormonal contraception increases the risk of HIV infection. PrEP and condom use have been verified to prevent HIV.
HIV Transmission Can HIV be contracted via a blood transfusion? It is possible, but the risk is extremely low with stringent screening procedures in place.
HIV Transmission Can you get HIV from a mosquito bite? No, HIV cannot be transmitted through mosquito bites. The virus does not survive in insects.
HIV Transmission Can I get HIV from kissing? Generally, no. However, open-mouth kissing with a HIV-positive partner who has open sores/ bleeding gums may pose a minimal risk.
HIV Transmission Can I get HIV from sharing food or drinks? No, HIV is not transmitted through sharing food or drinks. The virus does not survive in saliva or on surfaces. Can I get HIV from fomites No.
HIV Transmission Can HIV spread through skin-to-skin contact? No.
HIV Transmission Is HIV only transmissible through sexual activity? No. Needle sharing among people who use drugs can cause transmission of HIV. Mother-to-child transmission also occurs.
HIV Transmission Who is at risk of contracting HIV? People who engage in unprotected sex or high-risk sexual behaviour, multiple sexual partners simultaneously and people who share needles are among those at highest risk of getting infected.
HIV Transmission Can having other pre-existing STIs increase my chances of contracting HIV? The presence of pre-existing STIs such as gonorrhea or herpes can produce sores or breaks in the skin, facilitating entry of HIV into the bloodstream. It is important to seek treatment and abstain from sexual activity until recovery to prevent transmission.
HIV Transmission Why is the risk of HIV transmission higher with anal sex compared to vaginal sex? The fragile lining of the rectum allows for breakage and entry of the virus into the bloodstream. The rectum also has a higher population of CD4+ T cells, the hosts of the HIV virus.
HIV Transmission What are Men who have Sex with Men (MSM)? Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) refers to all men who engage in sexual activity with other men, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation or sexual identity.
HIV Transmission Why are Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) more at risk of contracting HIV compared to heterosexual men? MSM who engage in unprotected anal sex are at higher risk because the rectum lining is fragile compared to the vaginal lining, facilitating breakage and entry of the virus into the bloodstream. Added stigma prevents MSM from seeking treatment, further compounding the spread of the virus among this community.
HIV Transmission Can HIV be transmitted through sexual assault, rape or sodomy? Yes. Assault that involves condomless penetrative vaginal, anal, or oral sex potentially exposes the victim to HIV. Immediately seek medical attention for HIV Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) and other prophylactic treatments for bacterial STIs such as gonorrhea and chlamydia. It is advisable to report the event to local law enforcement and seek legal guidance where necessary.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Can HIV be transmitted through biting? The risk of HIV transmission through biting is low. Biting that causes bleeding should generally be avoided to minimize the risk of transmission.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP How effective are condoms in preventing transmission of HIV during sex? Male and female condoms are 90% and 94% effective respectively, when used correctly, provided there is no exchange of genital fluids after sex.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Does circumcision protect against HIV infection? Circumcision can reduce the likelihood of HIV infection. The foreskin is concentrated with Langerhans cells, which facilitate entry of the virus into the bloodstream. Removal of the foreskin reduces the risk of HIV and other STIs as the skin beneath is less susceptible to tears and abrasions.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP What is Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)? PrEP refers to a prophylactic medication regimen that when taken as prescribed, significantly reduces the likelihood of contracting a particular infection. PrEP is most often used in the context of HIV prevention.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP How does PrEP work to reduce HIV transmission? PrEP disrupts HIV replication, preventing the virus from establishing permanent residence in CD4+ T cells. PrEP also interferes with other HIV pathways, reducing the likelihood of T cell infection. Without infection of the T cells, HIV cannot replicate and cause disease.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP While on PrEP, can I contract HIV faster? No, PrEP is designed to reduce the risk of contracting HIV. When taken correctly and consistently, it significantly lowers the chance of HIV infection.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP How do I know if I need to take PrEP? Individuals engaging in high-risk sexual behaviour, unprotected sex, sex with a HIV-positive partner and people who inject drugs (needle-sharing) are encouraged to take PrEP.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP What are the steps to start PrEP? To start PrEP, schedule an appointment with a healthcare provider and undergo necessary tests (including HIV testing) before being provided with a prescription. Follow-up visits are required to monitor viral loads and overall health.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Can my primary care doctor prescribe PrEP? Yes, many primary care doctors can prescribe PrEP. If your doctor is not familiar with PrEP, they can refer you to a specialist or clinic that provides PrEP services.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP What are the medication options for PrEP? There are several medication options. Truvada – a combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) Descovy – a combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) Apretude – cabotegravir (CAB)
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Which of these options are most commonly used? Truvada is more widely used as it was approved for use as PrEP in 2012 by the FDA. Descovy (2019) and Apretude (2021) were approved later.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP What are the differences between the medication options for PrEP? Truvada, Descovy and Apretude have different chemical compositions. Furthermore, Truvada and Descovy are taken as daily pills, whereas Apretude is administered as an injection.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP What is the mode of action of PrEP? Truvada and Descovy block replication of viral genetic material. Apretude prevents integration of HIV genetic material into human DNA.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP What is the difference between Truvada and Descovy? Both are equally effective. Descovy may present with lower side effects on bone density and renal function for long-term use.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Can I expect any immediate side effects from PrEP use? Common side effects from PrEP use may include fatigue, gastrointestinal issues (diarrhea, vomiting or stomach discomfort) and headaches.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Who should not take PrEP? Neither Truvada nor Descovy are recommended for those with impairment of kidney and/or liver function. Injectable PrEP is recommended for those with kidney impairment as it is excreted through other pathways besides the kidney. All PrEP medications are not recommended for those with known hypersensitivity to the constituent drugs.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP I find it difficult to adhere to daily consumption of pills or I don’t want people to know I am taking PrEP. Are there other options for me? Apretude injections may be an option with administration once every two months. Initially, two doses will be given one month apart. This eliminates the need to adhere to a daily pill consumption regimen.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Can I take antibiotics with PrEP? Yes. These antibiotics are considered safe with PrEP use: amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin and doxycycline. However, using both concurrently may enhance side effects caused by each drug, while increasing the risk of kidney damage. It is not advisable to use aminoglycosides (gentamicin/amikacin) concurrently with PrEP as both compound the strain put on kidney function. Does PrEP interact with other medications Oral PrEP may interact or reduce the efficacy of methotrexate and Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) used for the treatment of arthritis. Interactions exist for other antiviral drugs, lithium, cancer treatment, HIV medication or drugs that affect the kidneys. Consult your healthcare professional for further information.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Are there any life-threatening side effects from PrEP use? Severe side effects include renal failure, lactic acidosis or liver problems. Consult a medical professional immediately with the onset of any unusual symptoms.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP What is the recommended regimen for PrEP? Oral PrEP is taken as a pill once daily without skipping doses. It is advisable to take the medication at the same time every day to maximize efficacy.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Will intake of PrEP affect my lifespan? No.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Are there long-term side effects from PrEP use? Possible long-term side effects are reduction in bone density and/or kidney impairment.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Do PrEP medications expire? Yes.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP What are the interactions of PrEP medication with alcohol? None. However, inebriation from alcohol may interfere with your ability to adhere to your PrEP regimen.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP What are the interactions of PrEP with recreational drugs (marijuana, heroin, etc.)? None.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Can I take recreational drugs while on PrEP? The use of recreational drugs may interfere with your ability to adhere to your PrEP regimen.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Can I take PrEP if I have comorbidities? Consult your doctor. Medications for the treatment of hepatitis B infection, kidney problems, cardiovascular problems and other viral infections may cause interactions with PrEP.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP What is the efficacy of PrEP during unsafe sex? PrEP is 99% effective when taken as advised.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Do I need to test for any diseases before starting PrEP? It is advised to test for HIV, Hepatitis B (HBV) and kidney function before starting PrEP. Consult your healthcare provider if you have any concerns.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Can I take PrEP if I already have HIV? No. The treatments for PrEP and HIV are distinct. Using PrEP with HIV could induce drug resistance in the virus, complicating treatment.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Will PrEP cure HIV? No. PrEP only reduces the likelihood of contracting HIV by up to 99%.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Do I have to take PrEP every day? PrEP use depends on lifestyle choices. Frequently engaging in unplanned, unprotected sex carries a high risk of HIV transmission and requires constant prophylaxis against HIV. For sexual activity that can be planned, event-based dosing is an option.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP What should I do if I miss one pill of PrEP? Take the missed dose within the same day if you remember. If it is close to your next dose, continue with the regimen as usual without taking both doses simultaneously.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Can I skip a few doses of PrEP? Do not skip doses. PrEP is most effective when taken daily, to maintain a specific level of the drug concentration in the bloodstream. Reducing the dosage will reduce protection against HIV, possibly causing infection. In the case where a person has been exposed, insufficient levels of PrEP could also induce HIV drug resistance.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP How can I improve the efficacy of PrEP? PrEP efficacy cannot be increased. However, concurrently practicing safe sex can reduce the likelihood of contracting HIV while on PrEP.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP How do I advise someone who is hesitant to take PrEP? Inform them of the benefits of PrEP and risks of untreated HIV while being empathetic. Directing them to pertinent resources on HIV prevention will increase awareness and highlight the importance of taking PrEP.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Is there an age range for PrEP usage? PrEP is recommended for sexually active adolescents and adults. Usage in children is determined on a case-by-case basis.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Will I have to take PrEP forever? As long as there is a risk of HIV infection from unsafe sexual practices/needle sharing, PrEP use is necessary to prevent infection. It is advisable to discuss the option of stopping PrEP with a healthcare provider.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Will I be able to discontinue PrEP? PrEP can be discontinued once the risk of infection is removed.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP What is event-based dosing (EBD)/2-1-1 method of taking PrEP? EBD, also known as PrEP on demand or 2-1-1, is practiced among gay men when intercourse can be planned. It requires taking two pills before sex and one pill 24 hours and 48 hours after. Truvada is the most widely used option for EBD.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Who should not practice event-based dosing of PrEP? Those who consistently engage in high-risk sexual behaviour without protection, have multiple sexual partners simultaneously and frequent unplanned sex, women and transgender men.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Can I start taking PrEP after I have been exposed to HIV? With suspected exposure, Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) is recommended. Otherwise, a history of unprotected sexual activity necessitates HIV testing before commencement of PrEP.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Can I test for HIV while on PrEP? Yes.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Can HIV PrEP protect you from other STIs/STDs? No, PrEP only protects against HIV and does not protect against other sexually transmitted infections. Using condoms along with PrEP is recommended to reduce the risk of other STIs/STDs.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP What kind of resources are available for me to learn more about PrEP and HIV? hiv.gov
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP I have been taking PrEP as prescribed, but I was exposed to HIV. What should I do? It is recommended to continue PrEP for a minimum of 28 days after the most recent high-risk exposure event.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP I have been exposed to someone with HIV during sexual activity. What do 	I do to avoid contracting the virus? Visit a healthcare provider to begin Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) within 72 hours of unprotected sexual intercourse. Efficacy of PEP reduces with time and is generally not recommended if more than 7 days have passed since the last event of unprotected intercourse.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Is PrEP expensive? The price range of PrEP may vary according to region. Use of generic medicines compared to brand-name medicines may lower the price point. Certain countries offer free preventative care for HIV or subsidies (such as Medicaid in the U.S.A). Contact your local healthcare provider or NGOs in your area for more information.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP What is PEP and how does it work? PEP (Post-Exposure Prophylaxis) is a cocktail of antiviral drugs that inhibits HIV at different stages of the replication cycle. One of the mechanisms of action includes preventing entry of the virus into CD4+ T cells.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Is one pill of PrEP right before sex sufficient to confer protection against HIV? No. Cis-gender MSM are required to take two pills, 2-20 hours before engagement in unprotected sexual activity. Followed by another pill at the 24 and 48-hour mark respectively. With frequent engagement in unprotected sex, daily use instead of EBD is recommended to maintain consistent protection.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP If I am on PrEP, do I have to use condoms? Using condoms on PrEP provides an added layer of protection against the HIV virus. Using condoms may also reduce the transmission of other STIs.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Is PrEP better than condoms or vice versa? PrEP and condoms offer different types of protection. For high-risk behaviour, concurrent use of both PrEP and condoms are encouraged as it may provide higher levels of protection than the individual interventions.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP How do I take PEP? Take one dose of PEP at the same time every day, for 28 days without skipping doses.
Prevention, HIV PrEP and PEP Can I skip one pill of PEP? Do not skip doses. Skipping one dose can reduce therapy's effectiveness while failing to establish a baseline drug concentration sufficient to inhibit viral replication.
HIV Viral Load and Testing Why is PEP not effective after 72 hours? After 72 hours without therapeutic intervention, it is likely that the virus could have infected CD4+ T cells. Once infected, the virus resides permanently within the cell, and this infection cannot be reversed. Infection of a single CD4+ T cell is sufficient to cause widespread dissemination of HIV.
HIV Viral Load and Testing What is a viral load? A viral load is the quantity of virus in the blood which is quantified as the number of copies of viral genetic material per mililitre of blood. While viral load can apply to other viral infections, it is primarily associated with HIV.
HIV Viral Load and Testing What is RNA? Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is the type of genetic material carried by HIV particles.
HIV Viral Load and Testing What are the categories of viral load? Viral load varies from undetectable/negative, low to high.
HIV Viral Load and Testing What is the range for each category? Undetectable = Less than 50 copies of HIV RNA per millilitre of blood Low = Less than 1000 copies of HIV RNA per millilitre of blood Moderate/Intermediate = 1,000 to 10,000 copies of HIV RNA per millilitre of blood High = More than 10, 000 copies of HIV RNA per millilitre of blood
HIV Viral Load and Testing Why is a high viral load bad? A high viral load could indicate that a person is either not taking/adhering to ART or that the strain of HIV is resistant to treatment.
HIV Viral Load and Testing Why is it important to screen for HIV viral load? Viral loads are continuously monitored to determine progression of the virus and efficacy of Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART). A high viral load during treatment may indicate drug resistance.
HIV Viral Load and Testing How can someone with a low/undetectable viral load still test for HIV? The nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) which detects genetic material is the most sensitive test and can detect HIV in individuals with low/undetectable viral loads. Additionally, antibody tests can detect antibodies regardless of the viral load as the body continuously produces antibodies against HIV.
HIV Viral Load and Testing Does a low viral load mean I am cured of HIV? No. HIV is incurable. A low viral load means the infection is well controlled and replication of the virus is inhibited by ART. Following a recent unprotected sexual encounter where exposure to HIV could have occurred, it could also mean that the viral load is too low to be detectable.
HIV Viral Load and Testing How do I determine my viral load? A viral load assay is used to determine viral load.
HIV Viral Load and Testing If my partner has an undetectable viral load, can we engage in unprotected sex? An undetectable viral load must be maintained for at least six months, with continued adherence to ART.
HIV Viral Load and Testing What is HIV-negative and HIV-positive? Both terms are used to indicate the presence or absence of HIV. HIV-negative indicates that a person does not have HIV. HIV-positive means that a person has been infected with HIV.
HIV Viral Load and Testing How do I determine my HIV status? Purchase an HIV self-test kit or ask for an HIV test at the nearest clinic. Clinicians can recommend a suitable test based on your history.
HIV Viral Load and Testing I want to test myself for HIV without interacting with a healthcare professional. How do I do this? Purchase a self-test kit at the nearest pharmacy. Certain non-governmental organizations may provide free HIV self-test kits/in-person testing.
HIV Viral Load and Testing Do I need to fast before taking an HIV test? No. Diet does not affect the outcome of an HIV test.
HIV Viral Load and Testing My self-test kit results are positive. What should I do now? Perform a confirmatory test with a healthcare professional.
HIV Viral Load and Testing What is a false negative in HIV testing? A false negative occurs when a person has HIV, but the HIV test results are negative.
HIV Viral Load and Testing What is a false positive in HIV testing? A false positive in HIV test results occurs when an individual is not infected yet tests positive for HIV. It occurs primarily because of technical errors, low specificity of the tests used and/or base rate fallacy.
HIV Viral Load and Testing What is base rate fallacy? The base rate fallacy is a tendency to overlook the prevalence of HIV in a population when interpreting test results, relying entirely on the outcome of testing. Since no test is 100% accurate, it is necessary to consider the occurrence of HIV in the local population before conferring a diagnosis or repeat testing.
HIV Viral Load and Testing What is the difference between specificity and sensitivity? In HIV testing, specificity is the test's ability to detect only HIV and no other similar viruses. Sensitivity is the ability of the test to detect HIV, even when it is present in extremely low viral loads.
HIV Viral Load and Testing Is there a trade-off for high specificity or sensitivity? Yes, the most sensitive tests may not be highly specific for HIV whereas the most specific tests may not be able to detect HIV at very low viral loads.
HIV Viral Load and Testing What is the likelihood I received a false-negative result during my HIV test? It depends on the type of test and time frame of testing. If testing very early on after exposure, there is a chance of false negative results as the viral load/ antibodies are not undetectable yet.
HIV Viral Load and Testing My HIV test came back negative, is it possible I still have HIV? It depends on the window period. If the test was performed less than 2 weeks after exposure, false negative results may occur. Consult a healthcare provider for confirmatory testing based on your exposure history.
HIV Viral Load and Testing What is the most accurate confirmatory test for HIV? It depends on the window period. The combined Western blot and ELISA are considered gold standards for HIV confirmation, which is routinely performed after an initial positive test.
HIV Viral Load and Testing How do I know if I need to get tested for HIV? It is recommended to conduct an HIV test at least once as part of routine healthcare.
HIV Viral Load and Testing How often should I get tested for HIV if I engage in high-risk sexual behaviour (e.g. multiple sexual partners)? Testing for HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) is recommended every 3 months.
HIV Viral Load and Testing Can I get tested for HIV immediately after exposure? Testing immediately after exposure is not advised as the virus needs a window period for replication, before it can be detected by tests. With possible exposure, it is recommended to start Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) as soon as possible to prevent infection.
HIV Viral Load and Testing Can pregnancy affect HIV testing? No. Pregnancy has no effect on the results of HIV testing results.
HIV Viral Load and Testing Can pregnant women test for HIV? Yes. It is important for pregnant women to get tested, to prevent transmission to the unborn child.
HIV Viral Load and Testing What are the factors that could affect testing? Yes. Pre-existing viral infections could result in false positives depending on the type of test. Furthermore, the timing of the test needs to be accurate to ensure the results are conclusive. Consult your healthcare provider for more information.
HIV Viral Load and Testing Are there any risks from HIV testing? HIV tests are not known to pose any risks. However, individuals awaiting results may experience some anxiety.
HIV Viral Load and Testing Can I receive counseling before testing? Yes. Pre-counseling may be sought (depending on the location of testing) to learn more about the testing rationale, procedure and outcome of test results.
HIV Viral Load and Testing Can a healthcare provider refuse to perform an HIV test? Yes, but only if there is no medical reason to perform the test. Healthcare providers cannot refuse without basis.
HIV Viral Load and Testing What does it mean if an HIV test outcome is inconclusive? An inconclusive test will either require repeat testing or another type of test that is more conclusive (e.g. Western blot).
HIV Viral Load and Testing What types of HIV tests are there? Three broad categories – antibody, antigen and RNA tests.
HIV Viral Load and Testing What are some examples of antibody tests? Saliva self-test kits, Western blots, ELISA, Rapid HIV Antibody tests.
HIV Viral Load and Testing What are some examples of antigen tests? The p24 antigen test is most common, whereas the gp120 and gp41 tests are less frequently used in a clinical setting.
HIV Viral Load and Testing What is a combined antigen/antibody test? A combined antigen/antibody test detects the presence of both antigens and antibodies. It is considered the most advanced form of testing available.
HIV Viral Load and Testing What do generations mean in the context of HIV testing? Generations (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th) are used to designate the advancements in HIV testing. With each generation, the sensitivity, cross-reactivity and window period for testing has been improved. 1st generation tests: Basic Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) with significant cross-reactivity. 2nd generation tests: ELISA with reduced cross-reactivity but sensitive to only one type of antibody. 3rd generation tests: ELISA with increased sensitivity to two different antibodies. 4th generation tests: Combined Antigen/Antibody testing with reduced window period (2-3 weeks).
HIV Viral Load and Testing What is the difference between antigens and antibodies? Antigens are proteins found on the surface of an HIV particle. These antigens trigger an immune response. One example is the p24 antigen, which is screened for using the p24 antigen test. Antibodies are produced by the immune system in response to the presence of HIV antigens during an infection. Antibodies against HIV are detected using various tests; however, a longer window period is needed to allow for the immune response to develop.
HIV Viral Load and Testing What are some examples of RNA tests? The HIV RNA test, also known as Nucleic Acid Tests (NATs), detects HIV genetic material in blood samples. These tests are considered the most sensitive. RNA tests use Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to detect HIV genetic material when antibody levels might still be low during the acute phase of infection.
HIV Viral Load and Testing How long do I have to wait before testing for HIV after exposure? RNA Test – 9 to 11 days post-exposure Antigen Test – 2 to 6 weeks post-exposure Antibody Test – 3 to 12 weeks post-exposure
HIV Viral Load and Testing Are there downsides to using self-test kits? Self-test kits detect antibodies in oral fluids, which are generally less concentrated than in blood or genital secretions. Furthermore, individuals who have been recently infected may not have the minimum amount of antibodies required for detection by the kits.
HIV Viral Load and Testing Why is it important to get tested for HIV? Awareness of HIV status can significantly reduce transmission of the virus. Furthermore, early diagnosis is imperative to improve mortality and delay the onset of AIDS.
HIV Viral Load and Testing Is HIV testing confidential? HIV testing can be confidential or anonymous. Confidential testing means that your HIV test results will include your name and other identifying information, and the results will be included in your medical record.  Anonymous testing means you do not have to give your name when you take an HIV test. The test identifier will be a random number assigned to you.
HIV Viral Load and Testing Where can I direct someone who wants to get tested for HIV? To local healthcare providers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) or community health centers that provide testing services. Self-test kits may also be purchased and conducted privately.
HIV Viral Load and Testing Can HIV tests detect all subtypes and strains? All available HIV tests can detect HIV-1 and HIV-2. However, it is not known if new or emerging variants could possibly evade detection by these tests.
Treatment and Management Can antidepressants interfere with the results of HIV tests? Antidepressants are not known to interfere with HIV testing results. Most drugs excluding those with immunosuppressive ability do not affect test results.
Treatment and Management I have been diagnosed with HIV. What do I do? Consult a medical professional and start Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) immediately to reduce your viral load.
Treatment and Management What are the treatment options for HIV? Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) is the treatment of choice for managing HIV infections.
Treatment and Management How does Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) work? ART reduces the number of virus particles circulating in the bloodstream, effectively suppressing replication of the virus. The low viral load ensures immune cells are uninfected and still functional, effectively preventing the onset of AIDS.
Treatment and Management What kind of medications exist for ART? Nucleoside/Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) Protease Inhibitors (PIs) Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors (INSTIs) Entry Inhibitors Pharmacokinetic Enhancers Fixed-Dose Combination Drugs
Treatment and Management Which of these are recommended for recent diagnosis? Two NRTIs with one of these three drug classes: NNRTIs, INSTIs or PIs. Consult a medical professional for further information.
Treatment and Management What is treatment adherence? Treatment adherence means starting HIV treatment upon diagnosis, keeping all medical appointments, and taking HIV medicines daily as prescribed (also called medication adherence). For people with HIV, treatment adherence is key to improving disease outcome.
Treatment and Management How effective is Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) for HIV? Up to 90% of HIV positive people who adhere to the ART regimen have undetectable viral loads within 12 months.
Treatment and Management How do I improve the outcome of HIV infection? Adhering to the ART regimen, practicing good lifestyle habits (dietary, exercise), reduction of smoking, alcohol consumption.
Treatment and Management How does a healthy lifestyle improve HIV outcome? A healthy lifestyle strengthens the immune system, potentially augmenting the effects of ART.
Treatment and Management Is PrEP the same as HIV treatment (ART)? Medication used for PrEP and HIV treatment (ART) may overlap, however the regimens and treatment protocols are different and not interchangeable.
Treatment and Management What are the side effects of Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART)? Side effects of ART are similar to PrEP – possible reduction in bone density and kidney impairment.
Treatment and Management Do I have to take HIV medication forever? Yes. Even brief discontinuation of therapy can cause a rebound in viral load or mutations in HIV-positive individuals.
Treatment and Management What is drug resistance in HIV treatment? Drug resistance occurs when the virus mutates, and existing therapy becomes less or completely ineffective (resistant).
Treatment and Management What causes drug resistance during HIV treatment? Non-compliance with treatment, not following the recommended regimen and interrupting treatment by skipping doses.
Treatment and Management How does skipping a few doses of treatment cause drug resistance? Skipping doses reduces the concentration of drugs required to suppress HIV replication. When treatment is compromised, the virus resumes replication, leading to the proliferation of viral particles. This proliferation effectively 'selects' for viral particles resistant to existing drugs. Eventually, viral particles susceptible to the existing drugs will die off once treatment is resumed, leaving the resistant ones to multiply.
Treatment and Management How can I reduce the likelihood of drug resistance occurring? Taking HIV medicines every day, as prescribed (medication adherence) reduces the risk of drug resistance. Regular follow ups to ascertain viral load are equally important to monitor progress.
Treatment and Management What is a CD4 count? A CD4 count is a type of test that measures the number of CD4+ T cells in the bloodstream.
Treatment and Management Why is it important to test for a CD4 count? Monitoring of CD4 count is important in ensuring that the ART is working to preserve existing CD4+ T cells in HIV-positive individuals.
Treatment and Management What are the healthy and unhealthy ranges of CD4 count? The healthy range of CD4 count is typically between 500 and 1500 cells per cubic millilitre of blood. In untreated individuals with HIV, CD4 counts can drop below 200 cells per cubic millilitre of blood.
Sexual Practices and Risks Can stem cell therapy cure HIV? Stem cell therapy holds promise but is not considered a cure due to the complex nature of the procedure, complications and scarcity of donors.
Sexual Practices and Risks What are some strategies for maintaining sexual health in a long-term relationship? Strategies include regular testing, practicing safe sex, open communication about sexual health, mutual agreement on prevention methods, and maintaining trust and honesty.
Sexual Practices and Risks Can two HIV-positive individuals engage in unprotected sex since they are both infected with the virus already? No. Engaging in unprotected sex could potentially increase viral loads while causing superinfection with different strains or subtypes of HIV. Sex with a person not adhering to treatment significantly increases the risk of contracting a drug-resistant strain.
Sexual Practices and Risks How do I avoid contracting HIV while being sexually active? Always practicing safe sex (correct use of condoms), usage of PrEP, awareness of HIV status.
Sexual Practices and Risks How can I further protect myself against HIV while having sex while using condoms? Using Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) as an added layer of HIV prevention.
Sexual Practices and Risks What methods of protection can I instill with my partner who has HIV? Ensuring your partner is actively receiving treatment for HIV. Practicing safe sex (condoms) and using PrEP.
Sexual Practices and Risks What is the correct way to use a condom? Use a fresh, unexpired condom every time during a new sexual act. Do not re-use soiled condoms. Put on the condom before engaging in any genital contact and use water or silicon-based lubricants to prevent breakage. Abstain from using saliva as a lubricant. Resources on how to use different types of condoms can be found here: ttps://www.cdc.gov/condom-use/communication-resources/index.html.
Sexual Practices and Risks Can I use an oil-based lubricant during sex? Oil-based lubricants such as Vaseline can reduce the integrity of latex condoms, causing tears or breaks in the material which may cause the transmission of HIV and/or other STIs. Opt for water-based or silicone-based lubricants instead.
Sexual Practices and Risks Can I wear two condoms at once to increase my chances of protection? Simultaneously using two condoms does not confer increased protection against HIV or other STIs. In fact, using two condoms can increase the chances of slippage or breakage from increased friction.
Sexual Practices and Risks Does washing or urinating after sex reduce the risk of contracting STIs/STDs? The practice of urinating after sexual intercourse is to flush out bacteria that may have entered the urinary tract, which reduces the likelihood of contracting a urinary tract infection (UTI) after sex. The urinary tract is typically not involved in the initial stages of an STI infection, as transmission usually involves the skin and/or mucous membranes. Washing is part of good hygienic practice but is not known to affect STI transmission significantly, as deep-seated regions targeted by these infections are hard to reach.
Sexual Practices and Risks Will using saliva as a lubricant during sex increase the chances of contracting HIV? Saliva from an HIV-positive individual who has open sores and/or bleeding gums may increase the risk of transmission. Furthermore, saliva may not be an adequate lubricant, increasing tearing during intercourse. The use of saliva facilitates the spread of other STIs and is not recommended as a lubricant.
Sexual Practices and Risks By being a top in a relationship, does that make me non-exempt from contracting HIV? No, being a top (insertive partner) in a sexual relationship does not make you exempt from contracting HIV. While the risk of HIV transmission is lower for the insertive partner during anal sex compared to the receptive partner, it's still a possibility.
Sexual Practices and Risks What is rimming and can it transmit STDs/STIs? Rimming, or oral-anal sex, involves licking the anus. It can transmit STIs/STDs such as herpes, HPV, and hepatitis A, as well as intestinal parasites. It is important to maintain good personal hygiene during the act, use protective barriers such as dental dams or plastic wrap or refrain altogether.
Sexual Practices and Risks What is fisting? Fisting is the sexual act of inserting a fist into a partner’s rectum. It increases the risk of contracting HIV and other STIs/STDs from possible cuts and abrasions to the rectal wall. It is advisable to use gloves and lubricants during fisting to prevent transmission of STIs/STDs such as HIV.
Sexual Practices and Risks What is barebacking? Barebacking refers to having sex without using condoms. It increases the risk of contracting HIV and other STIs/STDs.
Sexual Practices and Risks What is chemsex? Chemsex refers to the use of drugs like methamphetamine, GHB, or mephedrone to enhance or prolong sexual experiences. It can increase the risk of STIs/STDs and other health issues.
Sexual Practices and Risks What is cruising? Cruising is the act of seeking anonymous sexual encounters in public places. It can pose risks for transmission of STIs/STIDs due to the often anonymous and unprotected nature of the encounters.
Sexual Practices and Risks Can stress affect the likelihood of contracting an STI/STD? Stress itself does not increase the likelihood of contracting an STI/STD, but it can weaken the immune system, potentially making it harder to fight off infections.
Sexual Practices and Risks What role does alcohol consumption play in the risk of contracting STIs/STDs? Alcohol can impair judgment and lower inhibitions, potentially leading to risky sexual behaviors such as unprotected sex, which increases the risk of contracting STIs/STDs.
Sexual Practices and Risks What is douching? Douching refers to washing or cleaning out the inside of the anus or vagina with water or other fluids. It is not recommended for vaginal health and can disrupt the natural balance of bacteria, leading to infections.
Sexual Practices and Risks What are dental dams? Dental dams are thin pieces of latex or polyurethane used during oral sex to prevent the spread of STI/STDs. They act as a barrier between the mouth and the genital or anal area.
Sexual Practices and Risks What are condoms used for? Condoms are used to prevent pregnancy and reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) by acting as a barrier that prevents the exchange of bodily fluids during sex.
Sexual Practices and Risks What is a top? A top is a person who typically takes the insertive role in sexual activities, particularly in anal sex.
Sexual Practices and Risks What is a bottom? A bottom is a person who typically takes the receptive role in sexual activities, particularly in anal sex.
Sexual Practices and Risks What is versatile? Versatile refers to a person who is comfortable taking either the insertive or receptive role in sexual activities.
Sexual Practices and Risks What is non-binary? Non-binary is a gender identity that does not fit within the traditional binary of male or female. Non-binary individuals may identify as both, neither, or somewhere in between.
Sexual Practices and Risks What is a threesome? A threesome is a sexual activity that involves three people.
Sexual Practices and Risks What is the meaning of ‘Undetectable equals Untransmissible’? Undetectable equals Untransmissible or U=U means that HIV-positive persons with undetectable viral loads generally cannot transmit the virus during unprotected sexual activity due to treatment adherence. The undetectable status must be maintained for a minimum of six months.
Community and Support Does the age of a sexual partner affect the risk of HIV transmission? Yes, the age of a sexual partner can affect HIV transmission risk. Having an older partner may alter power dynamics, potentially affecting sexual practices, condom usage and/or decisions on sexual health. Cultural standards may also exacerbate these dynamics. Understanding these dynamics will facilitate targeted interventions for specific age groups.
Community and Support How can I support a partner who has been diagnosed with an STI/STD? Offer emotional support, encourage them to promptly seek medical treatment. Educating yourself about the infection will help to alleviate stigma and provide informed support.
Community and Support What are the three C’s in HIV? Increasing the acceptability of HIV counseling and testing with three C's: convenience, confidentiality and credibility.
Community and Support How Is HIV different for older people? The number of older people with HIV is growing due to improved prognosis from treatment availability. However, thousands of older people are annually diagnosed with HIV and other STIs every year. Stigma combined with a lack of awareness may prevent elderly individuals from seeking treatment.
Community and Support How can I find an LGBTQ+-friendly healthcare provider? Look for healthcare providers listed by LGBTQ+ health organizations, ask for recommendations from local LGBTQ+ groups, or check online directories.
Community and Support How do I advise someone who doesn’t want to get tested for HIV? Highlight responsibility while removing stigma. Provide information and direct them to resources. Offer them encouragement and support by following up on them.
Community and Support How can I find support groups for HIV-positive individuals? Support groups can be found through local LGBTQ+ centers, healthcare providers, online forums, and non-governmental organizations.
Community and Support How do you protect your privacy and confidentiality regarding your HIV status? Privacy and confidentiality can be protected by actively knowing your rights according to local legal guidelines and being careful and selective about disclosure.
Community and Support What support systems do you rely on to cope with HIV-related stigma? Seek out resources for dealing with HIV-related stigma online; look for communities online or in-person (support groups).
Community and Support Is it possible to experience HIV-related stigma from healthcare providers? Yes. If an experience with a healthcare provider has been unpleasant, seek out alternative care elsewhere or reach out to local HIV/AIDS organizations for more information.
Community and Support How do you support others who may be experiencing HIV-related stigma? Offer empathy, share resources, create safe spaces for those experiencing HIV-related stigma to express themselves or encourage them to seek counseling/ get involved with local HIV/AIDS organizations.
Community and Support What is stigma? HIV can prompt intense feelings in people, regardless of their HIV status. It is sometimes viewed with a sense of unacceptability or disgrace. A person with HIV may feel shame and despair about their status. An HIV-negative person may be fearful or angry when they discover someone has HIV. The relationship of these feelings to HIV is referred to as stigma. HIV stigma can also affect those at risk of HIV by discouraging them from seeking HIV prevention tools and testing, and from talking openly with their sex partners about safer sex options.
Community and Support How can I combat HIV-related stigma? You can reduce stigma and discrimination by offering support and speaking out to correct myths and stereotypes about HIV that you hear from others. What is discrimination While stigma refers to an attitude or belief, discrimination is the behaviours that result from those attitudes or beliefs. HIV discrimination is the act of treating people living with HIV differently than those without HIV. Here are a few examples: A health care professional refusing to provide care or services to a person living with HIV Refusing casual contact with someone living with HIV Socially isolating a community member because they are HIV positive Referring to people as HIVers or Positives
Community and Support What are the effects of HIV stigma and discrimination? HIV stigma and discrimination affect PLHIV emotionally and mentally. PLHIV often internalize the stigma, fearing discrimination or judgement upon disclosure. “Internalized stigma” or “self-stigma” happens when a person takes in the negative ideas and stereotypes and start to apply them to themselves. HIV-internalized stigma can lead to feelings of shame, fear of disclosure, isolation, and despair. These feelings can keep people from getting tested and treated for HIV.
Community and Support How can HIV stigma be alleviated? Raising awareness on the nature of HIV can help normalize the subject. It also provides opportunities to correct misconceptions and help others learn more about HIV.
Community and Support How do you respond to stigmatizing comments or behaviors from others? Educate and inform others respectfully.
Community and Support What impact can HIV-related stigma have on mental health? HIV related stigma may cause stress, anxiety or depression. It is important to seek out counseling, especially those conducted by HIV/AIDS organizations.
Community and Support How do you challenge negative stereotypes about people living with HIV? Negative stories about HIV stereotypes can be challenged by correcting misinformation.
Community and Support What is HIV phobia? HIV phobia is the irrational fear of HIV and PLHIV due to discrimination, stigma and misinformation.
Community and Support Why are PLHIV at a higher risk of mental health disorders? The stress associated with living with a serious illness or condition, such as HIV, can put a strain on mental health due to health-related anxiety. With the added fear of discrimination, PLHIV have a higher chance of developing mood, anxiety, and cognitive disorders. For example, depression is one of the most common mental health conditions faced by PLHIV. Also, some medications used to treat HIV may have side effects that affect mental health.
Myths and Misconceptions How do PLHIV experience situations that affect their mental health? Situations that negatively affect the mental health of PLHIV include disclosure to a partner/family, potential employer or healthcare provider. The stress of adhering to medication without skipping doses, the possibility of viral load relapse, keeping to medical appointments, awaiting test results as well as stigma and discrimination can all negatively affect mental health.
Myths and Misconceptions Is it true that HIV is only a problem in developing countries? No. HIV is a global health issue not confined to developing countries. Developing countries may be at risk of HIV epidemics due to poor infection control/ lack of resources to combat infection among the population.
Myths and Misconceptions Is HIV a death sentence or a terminal illness? HIV is no longer considered a death sentence. With early detection and treatment adherence, the prognosis for living with HIV is comparable to that of an uninfected person. People living with HIV can lead normal lives, have children, raise families and hold stable jobs.
Myths and Misconceptions Is HIV a ‘gay disease’? No. HIV is not confined to sexual orientation or gender.
Myths and Misconceptions Is it true that the semen of an HIV-positive individual is of a different colour? No. There is no way to identify HIV from the appearance of semen.
Myths and Misconceptions Is the type of cough produced by HIV or TB distinctive? There might be certain distinguishable characteristics (productive or non-productive) but there is no way to ascertain the causative agent of a cough from the sound alone. Only diagnostic tests can determine the source of infection.
Myths and Misconceptions Did humans get HIV through sexual intercourse with monkeys? No. The virus is thought to have been transmitted from non-human primates to humans through increased contact with SIV-infected monkeys from hunting and butchering of bushmeat. This is agreed upon by the scientific community.
Myths and Misconceptions Is PrEP only for those who are promiscuous? The notion that PrEP is exclusively for promiscuous individuals is a misconception that perpetuates stigma. PrEP is for anyone who is actively seeking protection against HIV.
Myths and Misconceptions Is HIV an African disease? No. HIV had its roots in Africa due to cultural practices but is not confined to the African continent. Disease occurrence is higher in Africa due to a lack of awareness and extreme poverty.
Myths and Misconceptions Does blood type affect my risk of contracting HIV? No, blood type is not a determinant of HIV infection.
Myths and Misconceptions Is it true that only certain people can contract HIV? No. The basis of HIV infection is the CD4+ T cells, which all humans possess. Rarely, certain individuals may possess mutations that confer various levels of protection against HIV infection. However, this mutation is not common among population groups.
Myths and Misconceptions Can herbal medicine cure HIV? No proof exists of the ability of traditional/herbal medicine to cure or treat HIV. It is important to adhere to Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) which has been tested and approved to maximize the chances of leading a normal, healthy life.
Myths and Misconceptions Can hormonal contraception protect against HIV? No. Hormonal contraception offers no protection against HIV. PrEP is the only medication that provides effective preventative HIV prophylaxis.
Disclosure Is it true that if ejaculation does not occur during unprotected sex, I will not contract HIV? No. HIV is present in pre-ejaculate or pre-cum, therefore it is possible to get infected through any form of unprotected sexual activity (oral, vaginal or rectal).
Disclosure How do I advise someone who is not disclosing their HIV-positive status while having unprotected sex? Discuss the importance of disclosure, highlight legal and ethical responsibilities, provide information on HIV ART.
Disclosure Do I have to disclose my HIV status to potential sexual partners? It is advisable and depends on legal jurisdiction, engagement in sexual activity and risk of transmission. Disclosure helps potential sexual partners make informed decisions about their sexual health.
Disclosure Do I need to disclose my HIV-positive status to my family? It is advisable to tell only those who may have been at risk of contracting HIV from sexual contact/needle sharing, or those who are potentially at risk. Ultimately, the choice is entirely personal.
Disclosure What kind of jobs require disclosure of HIV status? Healthcare jobs (doctors, dentists, nurses or midwives) where there is a risk of exposure to blood. Jobs in the military may require a full medical report before enrolment. Pilots and air crew may also be required to disclose their HIV status due to possible travel restrictions.
Disclosure Do I need to tell my employer that I have HIV? HIV disclosure to an employer depends on the nature of the job, whether the infection is controlled, and if HIV status could interfere with work. For example, jobs in healthcare, where the risk of transmission might be higher, may require disclosure. In these instances, safeguards are put in place to protect employees. However, most jobs do not require HIV disclosure. Legally, certain countries have instituted Disabilities Acts (e.g., the U.S.) that protect employees from being forced to disclose their HIV status.
Disclosure What are the possible risks/ benefits of disclosing my HIV status to an employer? Disclosure of HIV status to an employer when it is not required by law may cause stigma and discrimination by giving rise to unfounded fears. However, in certain cases, disclosure of HIV status may allow for flexibility in organizing medical appointments. Regardless, it is advisable not to disclose where it is not required.
Disclosure Can a potential employer ask me about my HIV status during an interview? No. Employers in many countries including the U.K. and the U.S.A. are legally prohibited from inquiring about your HIV status for low-risk jobs. Employers are only allowed to ask about disabilities and other health conditions that may interfere with your ability to work.
Disclosure What is HIV criminalization? HIV criminalization is the legal prosecution of a person due to their HIV-positive status or potential exposure. These laws may encompass reckless transmission through sexual activity, blood donation or even sexual assault. As of 2023, 34 states in the U.S.A. have laws that criminalize HIV exposure.
Disclosure Why is HIV criminalization stigmatizing? Criminalization of HIV transmission can be considered stigmatizing because it deters people from seeking diagnosis and treatment. People may be afraid to disclose their HIV status to potential partners and make educated decisions about their sexual health. Furthermore, it perpetuates negative connotation about HIV status.
Living with HIV In what situations is HIV criminalization warranted? Different schools of thought exist on the need for HIV criminalization. In instances of aggravated assault, sexual abuse, neglect to sterilize medical equipment and where clear intent to spread HIV can be proven, criminalization is generally warranted to deter intentional transmission and protect public health. However, in other instances (breastfeeding or pregnant mothers, consensual sex where either party is unaware, low risk activities) the need for criminalization is being debated.
Living with HIV What is PLHIV? People Living with HIV (PLHIV) is a conscientious and inclusive way of referring to people who have been infected with HIV.
Living with HIV Can I work in jobs that are close contact or involve food handling? Yes. There is little to no risk of transmission, however, it is imperative to maintain an undetectable viral load to eliminate the risk of transmission.
Living with HIV Can I plan for the future despite having HIV? With adherence to treatment, practicing safe sex and a healthy lifestyle, a normal lifespan is possible. Therefore, planning for the future is completely feasible.
Living with HIV Can HIV-positive individuals participate in sports and athletics? HIV-positive individuals can participate in sports and athletics, with proper precautions in place such as adherence to ART. With high viral loads, it is advisable to refrain from contact sports with high risk of injury that may facilitate transmission, until viral loads can be controlled and reduced.
Living with HIV Are there travel restrictions for People Living with HIV (PLHIV)? Certain countries bar the entry of HIV-positive individuals. Other countries may have restrictions on transiting, short-term stays, long-term stays and/or permanent residence. More importantly, individuals found to be HIV-positive may face detainment or deportation from certain countries such as Brunei, Jordan or Saudi Arabia. As these regulations frequently change, it is important to stay updated and to plan accordingly.
Living with HIV Which country is most difficult to enter with a HIV-positive status? According to hiv.gov, the country with most difficult entry is the U.S.A.
Living with HIV What precautions can I take while travelling with HIV? Firstly, ensure adherence to ART to reduce and maintain viral load. Next, maintain confidentiality by not disclosing HIV status to passengers, customs officials or immigration officers. Bear in mind that certain countries have jurisdiction that necessitates disclosure and HIV testing for long-term residence.
Living with HIV How do I disinfect a surface that has been contaminated with HIV (blood/ seminal fluids)? Disinfect surfaces with bleach (for 5 minutes) using gloves, then dispose of all contaminated materials.
Living with HIV Can one or both parents living with HIV give birth to uninfected children? Yes, with preventative measures in place. Infected partners are advised to adhere to Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) until the viral load is undetectable for a minimum of 6 months before proceeding with conception. Potential mothers who are HIV-positive are advised to adhere to the ART regimen, receive prenatal care, and undergo counseling. After birth, the newborn baby will be put on ART for an average of 6 months as a prophylactic measure.
Living with HIV How do I mentally deal with HIV? Reach out to local HIV/AIDS organizations for counseling services or support groups. Although family and friends can offer support, it is important to weigh the pros and cons of disclosure. Staying active with regular exercise and engaging in hobbies or pastimes can also alleviate stress.
History of HIV How to stop HIV-related anxiety? Educating yourself on the facts and outcome of HIV, reaching out to local HIV/AIDS organizations and support groups will help to alleviate symptoms. Talking to a healthcare provider about antidepressants may help to address anxiety. It is best to stimulants such as alcohol, marijuana, cigarettes and coffee as these have been shown to exacerbate anxiety.
History of HIV When did HIV infections peak? HIV infections peaked in 1995, with 3.4 million new infections, as reported by UNAIDS.
History of HIV What is the most famous HIV-related clinical trial in history? One of the most influential HIV-related clinical trials was the RV144 trial, also known as the Thai vaccine trial. The trial demonstrated that the vaccine was safe and provided a certain percentage of participants. However, the trial was discontinued as it was deemed to be ineffective.
History of HIV Where was HIV first discovered? HIV was first discovered in the early 1980s in the United States of America. Rare diseases (Kaposi’s sarcoma and pneumocystis pneumonia) which usually only affected the elderly and the immunocompromised, were occurring more frequently among gay men in New York and San Francisco. Upon investigation, it was discovered that a virus infecting the CD4+ T cells was causing AIDS. Further research led to the identification of HIV.
History of HIV Why was HIV first identified in gay men? HIV was first identified in gay men due to a lack of awareness on sexual health and safe sex practices within the community. Furthermore, it is known that male bathhouses in San Francisco encouraged increased sexual contact with frequent partner turnover in the 1980s. This combined with the ‘free love’ era of the 60s and 70s perpetuated the notion of sexual freedom, further increasing transmission among certain population groups.
History of HIV Why was the spread of HIV from Africa not contained? A lack of awareness and underdeveloped medical technology prevented the identification of the virus in Africa in the early 20th century. It is thought that widespread dissemination occurred in the 1920s in Kinshasa, Congo. The French railways built for industrial and economic purposes caused a population surge, where the number of male labourers exceeded the number of local women 2:1. This led to a boom in the local sex trade, increased the use of unsterilized needles to treat diseases among the laborers and facilitated the dissemination of HIV to neighbouring regions.
History of HIV Did HIV come from a monkey? HIV originated from Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) which was transmitted to humans through increased contact from hunting, butchering and consumption of bushmeat. The SIV virus is thought to have mutated to be able to infect human CD4+ T cells, resulting in the development of HIV.
History of HIV When did the HIV epidemic start? The HIV epidemic started in June 1981 and is now classified as a global pandemic.
History of HIV Who were the scientists responsible for identifying HIV? HIV discovery is attributed to two scientists, Luc Montagnier of France and Robert Gallo of the U.S.A.
History of HIV When was the first HIV detection test approved? The first HIV detection test was approved in 1985. The first-generation antibody test could detect HIV 6-12 weeks (about 3 months) post-infection.
History of HIV When was Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) first approved? The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first integrase inhibitor (raltegravir) in 2007.
Geographical Distribution of HIV How many people have died since the HIV pandemic began? It is estimated that 40.4 million people (about twice the population of New York) have died from HIV-related illnesses since the beginning of the pandemic.
Geographical Distribution of HIV Which region is the hotspot for new HIV infections? The southern region of Africa encompassing South Africa and Eswatini remains the hotspot for new HIV infections.
Geographical Distribution of HIV How does HIV prevalence differ in urban and rural areas? HIV prevalence in rural or urban areas may differ due to several factors. Rural areas may suffer poverty, lack of access to treatment/ diagnosis and a lack of awareness. This combined with increased stigma from a lack of education could exacerbate HIV incidence among rural populations. However, urban areas with higher migration rates and increased social media usage may contribute to higher incidence of HIV.
Geographical Distribution of HIV Why is the American South disproportionately affected by HIV? The higher burden of HIV in the American South is attributed to poverty, unemployment,  misinformation, poor healthcare infrastructure and a lack of knowledge.
Geographical Distribution of HIV How does the prevalence of HIV compare between indigenous and urban 	communities? Indigenous communities including First Nations, Inuit, and Métis in the U.S.A. generally have higher prevalence of HIV compared to urban communities. This is due to reduced healthcare infrastructure, poverty and higher rates of substance abuse.
Geographical Distribution of HIV How many people are living with HIV in the U.S.A.? As of 2021, approximately 1.2 million people in the United States had HIV, of whom 13% did not know their status, with 36,136 diagnoses within the same year.  Southern states accounted for 52% of all new HIV infections, followed by the Western states (21%), Midwestern and Northeastern states (14% each).

Geographical Distribution of HIV Which subtype is most common in the U.S.A.? Subtype B of HIV-1 is predominant in North America and parts of Europe.
Geographical Distribution of HIV Which HIV subtype is most prevalent in Africa? HIV-1, subtype C.
Geographical Distribution of HIV Which country has the highest incidence of HIV per capita in the Americas? The Bahamas. Poverty, lack of awareness, promiscuity and high rates of cocaine use among the population have contributed to the transmission of HIV among the population.
Geographical Distribution of HIV Which country has the highest incidence of HIV per capita in Asia? Thailand. The booming sex trade, combined with low condom usage are the primary reasons for high incidence of HIV in Thailand.
Geographical Distribution of HIV Which country has the highest incidence of HIV per capita in Europe? Latvia and Estonia. In both countries, injection drug use is attributed as the major cause of HIV dissemination.
Geographical Distribution of HIV Which country has the highest incidence of HIV per capita in the middle east? United Arab Emirates. The number of cases in UAE has increased significantly over the last ten years, owing to an increase in labor migration, tourists and the changing sexual landscape in the younger generation.
Geographical Distribution of HIV Which country has the highest incidence of HIV per capita in Africa? Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland). The primary reason for HIV transmission in Eswatini is thought to be food insecurity. This has led to an increase in transactional sex, unsafe sexual practices and sexual violence against women. The poverty level has also led to poor adherence to ART.
Geographical Distribution of HIV Which country has the highest incidence of HIV per capita in the Pacific? Papua New Guinea. The high incidence of unsafe sex (multiple sexual partners simultaneously), transactional sex and sexual violence against women are thought to be contributing factors to HIV incidence.
Geographical Distribution of HIV Where is HIV most prevalent in the world?

HIV among the MSM community Which countries have successfully reduced new HIV infection rates? Eleven African countries have successfully reduced the number of new infections by double the global average: Botswana, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. These countries have instituted the use of condoms as well as encouraging voluntary male circumcision. Furthermore, an emphasis has also been placed on treatment and disease management where the average rate of viral suppression among these countries is 85%.
HIV among the MSM community What are the statistics for HIV/AIDS in gay black men in America? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), gay and bisexual black men are disproportionately affected by HIV. Although they represent a small portion of the overall American population, they account for a significant percentage of new HIV diagnoses. In 2019, gay and bisexual black men made up approximately 26% of new HIV diagnoses in the United States, despite being only a fraction of the total population. Factors such as socioeconomic disparities, limited access to healthcare, stigma, and discrimination contribute to these higher rates.
HIV among the MSM community What is the risk of contracting HIV as a gay black man in America? Gay black men face a 1 in 2 risk of contracting HIV in America.
HIV among the MSM community How has technology influenced the transmission of HIV among the MSM population? The advent of dating apps and hook-up sites have facilitated increased sexual activity among the MSM community. This is generally assumed to have increased HIV and/or STI incidence among the MSM community. However, technology has also improved access to resources on HIV prevention and treatment and could be further utilized to improve the landscape of HIV among the MSM community.
HIV among the MSM community How does sex work among the MSM community influence risk of HIV transmission? Sex work is often considered high risk with the frequent partner turnover, inconsistent use of contraception and stigma. The added risk of sexual violence increases the risk of contracting HIV and/or other STIs.
HIV among the MSM community Are MSM at a higher risk of discrimination from healthcare workers? Generally, yes. In certain regions cultural discrimination against the LGBTQ community is prevalent. This combined with pre-existing stigma surrounding HIV may increase the risk of discrimination against members of the MSM community.
HIV among the MSM community What makes access to HIV-related healthcare easier for the MSM community? Access to HIV-related healthcare for the MSM community can be improved through Increased awareness on the importance of screening, treatment and prevention of HIV. Support networks or counseling and access to HIV/AIDS NGOs that could also assist in guiding MSM in seeking treatment and improving their quality of life.
HIV among the MSM community What inhibits access to HIV-related healthcare among the MSM community? Stigma and discrimination may prevent MSM from seeking diagnosis and/or treatment due to increased fear of being ostracized.
Miscellaneous What kind of organizations offer support for MSM living with HIV in the U.S.A.? Gay Men’s Health Crisis (GMHC).
Miscellaneous What is a bloodborne pathogen or infection? Bloodborne pathogens or infections are pathogens that require exposure to blood for transmission. These pathogens may also be transmitted through other routes including sexual activity or vertical transmission.
Miscellaneous Has anyone been cured of HIV? Yes. One person is verified to have been cured of HIV. Timothy Ray Brown, also known as the ‘Berlin Patient’, received a stem cell transplant for leukemia, consisting of CD4+ T cells with mutated CCR5 receptors which are required for infection. Within 3 months, HIV was not detected in his blood and HIV-specific antibodies declined significantly. Timothy stopped ART and lived for many years up until his death in 2020 from leukemia complications.
Miscellaneous What effect did the HIV epidemic have on blood transfusion protocols? In early 1982, reports emerged of opportunistic infections in hemophiliacs and healthy individuals in low-risk groups (e.g. children). These acquired immunodeficiencies were then linked to blood transfusions. After HIV was identified as the etiological agent of AIDS, rigorous screening protocols were instituted to reduce the risk of transmission of HIV and other bloodborne pathogens.
Miscellaneous Why is stem cell therapy not the first line of treatment against HIV? Stem cell therapy is not the first line of treatment due to its high-risk nature. Side effects such as organ damage, infection and Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) are potentially life-threatening. Finding a suitable donor could potentially mitigate these risks, however the process may be time-consuming and challenging. Furthermore, the procedure is complex and requires state-of-the-art facilities which may be costly and not widely available. As it is not commonplace for HIV treatment, the effectiveness of stem cell therapy for HIV is largely unknown. As such, ART remains the first line of treatment with its lower cost, less risk of side effects and proven effectiveness.
Miscellaneous What does a key population mean? Key populations are people groups who are at a higher risk of contracting HIV.
Miscellaneous What is dual protection? Dual protection is taking steps to prevent unwanted pregnancies and infection with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) which include HIV. Dual protection encompasses the use of hormonal contraception as well as physical contraception (condoms, IUDs, etc.).
Miscellaneous Can women living with HIV take hormonal contraception? Yes. Women living with HIV can take hormonal contraception to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
Miscellaneous Do hormonal contraceptives affect disease progression? The evidence is in favour of hormonal contraceptives having no effect on disease progression. However, one randomized controlled trial did find evidence of accelerated disease progression in women who used hormonal contraception. In spite of this, The World Health Organization (WHO) continues to recommend the use of hormonal contraception to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
Miscellaneous Does hormonal contraception protect against STIs/STDs? No. Only condoms protect against STIs, with PrEP offering protection against HIV as well.
Miscellaneous What is SIV? Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) is considered the progenitor of the HIV virus. SIV infects non-human primates in the African continent, and the crossover to humans is thought to have happened there.

Thana Segaran Dr. Rohani Ismail Dr. Rozaini Mat Shah Dr. Narimah Hanim Ibrahim Dr. Zaini Husin Dr. Rahimi Hassan Dr. Oui Siew Kim Dr. Selina Mohd Nor Dahalan Dr. Hayati Abdullah We would like to express our highest gratitude and thanks for the contributions made by those involved in the preparation of this guide book. 3 Foreword Generally there are three ways by which HIV can be prevented from spreading to couples through sex. First, to assume that all sex couples are HIV carriers and to use condom each time when performing sexual intercourse. With a breakthrough rate of 10%, reduction in risk as a result of the use of condom, is expected around 90%. However, many has considered the effectiveness of using condom is just around 70% only. Possibility of clear reduction in the HIV virus spread has made the WHO and other International organizations to choose condom as the main prevention method. Secondly, which is the method that had always been generally discussed is the use of vaccine. Until the present day, it is still being researched. Although in future the suitable vaccine will be produced, its effectiveness is expected to be around 60%, (equal to the vaccine for Cholera) to 95% (equal to the vaccine for Measles). The third method, which seems to be giving high hopes, is the voluntary HIV test. Depending on the sensitivity of the test and the “window period”; this strategy will be able to reduce the risk of spread between 95% - 99% if they use the HIV infection status information to avoid sexual intercourse. The voluntary HIV test which is supported by counseling should be part of our main respond in our efforts to tackle AIDS. At the individual level, the test process will give the opportunity to obtain “informed consent” and to give information regarding the disease, its prevention method and support to new patients. At the programme level, it is the main component in creating an environment that is supportive to the people that are most vulnerable to participate in our prevention and control efforts. I would like to record my appreciations to all those involved, with
all the cooperation and commitment in combating the HIV/AIDS problem in this country. 4 I would also like to express my highest appreciations and thanks to the officers of the Ministry of Health for their contributions in the preparation of this Guide Book. It is our hope that this Guide Book will be used by members in the implementation of the “Anonymous and Voluntary HIV Screening programme in the whole country. Thank you. Tan Sri Datu Dr. Hj. Mohamad Taha bin Arif Director General of Health Ministry of Health Malaysia 5 “ ANONYMOUS AND VOLUNTARY HIV SCREENING ” PROGRAMME 1. INTRODUCTION HIV/AIDS is a disease that infects someone only once in his life and there is no remedy to it. Preventive steps such as not performing sexual intercourse before marriage,not taking drugs and not performing sexual intercourse with people whom are not their life partners are steps that could prevent the spread of HIV. However, the spread of this disease could be prevented if a person knows that he is infected by HIV and he takes the necessary steps to prevent it from spreading to other people. Through this Anonymous and Voluntary HIV Screening programme, an individual could know the HIV status within 15 minutes by using the “rapid test” method. An individual does not have to disclose his/ her personal details including his/her name and address when undergoing this test. Only information relating to age, race, sex and risks habits will be taken from individuals when undergoing this “anonymous” test.This service is provided at all government health clinics every working day during office hours. For individuals whom had been confirmed infected by HIV, all personal information relating to the patient will be handled confidentially by respective officers only. Patient will be referred for further care through a service package that covers counseling, follow–up checks and treatment that will be provided at Health Clinics and also Hospitals. 6 2.
